	Special Case - "rd" - almost any number ending in 3 is given the "rd" suffix.

	getRandomInteger
	
	generates a random number between the lower bound (inclusive) and the upper bound (inclusive).
	
	In order to work through the algorithm, you need to consider the different conditions that might exist.
	
	Generating a number from 0 to x is parseInt(Math.random() * (x + 1))
	What about generating a number from 1 to x?
	What about generating a number from x to y?
	What about generating a number from -x to y?

	parameters:
		lower - the lower bound of the range of random numbers.
		upper - the upper bound of the range or random numbers.
		
	returns:
		a random number between lower and upper, inclusive.
		a random number between lower and upper, inclusive.
